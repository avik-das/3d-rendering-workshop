  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>These is the course guide for a workshop I'm holding at <a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/">Bradfield School of Computer Science</a>. In the two-day workshop, I go through the fundamentals of 3D graphics, with an emphasis on foundational knowledge and hands-on experimentation. The workshop also lets me answer questions in person and help move students along the coursework in a timely fashion, but even without my presence, the material should be useful to a wider audience.</p>

  <p>The workshop is laid out a series of lessons, each with a corresponding project. Students learn one foundational concept in each lesson, then implement that concept in their very own 3D renderer.</p>

  <p>The full source for multiple implementations of the renderer is available, with one commit per lesson. This way, if a student gets stuck on one lesson, they can experiment with another lesson by starting at a partial implementation of the renderer ready to go. This is especially useful in a live workshop, preventing students from falling behind. Interested learners are highly encouraged to do their own implementations from scratch, however.</p>
