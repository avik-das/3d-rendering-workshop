  <h1>Project 2: Rendering unshaded spheres</h1>

  <h2>Goals</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Represent geometry in the scene</li>
    <li>Perform intersection tests to determine visibility</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In this project, we will add a set of spheres to the world, then rendered them with no lighting. Each sphere can be given its own color, giving us an image like this one:</p>

  <div class="figure" id="figure-unshaded-spheres">
    <img width="256" alt="Three spheres of three different colors. All the spheres are flat." src="../img/unshaded-spheres.png"/>

    <p class="caption">Three unshaded spheres.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="step">Add spheres to the world</h2>

  <p>Create a representation of a sphere consisting of two pieces of information:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A center point. This is the location of the sphere, as a 3D vector.</li>
    <li>A radius. This is just a scalar.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Add a few of these spheres into the scene.</p>

  <h2 class="step">Add color to the spheres</h2>

  <p>As you've seen in the previous project, a color consists of red, green and blue components, each in the range of `[0, 255]`. Because we're going to combine multiple colors in future lessons, we will represent colors with components in the range `[0, 1]`. Then, we will convert this into a range our pixel plotting function can accept at the very end, right before plotting a pixel.</p>

  <p>Represent a color with three non-integer components, each between zero and one. Add one more piece of information to the representation of each sphere: its color.</p>

  <h2 class="step">Perform ray-sphere intersection tests</h2>

  <p>For each of the rays you created in the previous project, loop through all the spheres in the scene and perform an intersection test on them. Recall that we found a quadratic equation encoding the solutions of the intersection test:</p>

  <p>
    \begin{array}
    \\a &amp; t^2 &amp; + &amp; b &amp; t &amp; + &amp; c &amp; = &amp; 0 \\
    \left( \Vert \vec{\mathbf{d}} \Vert ^ 2 \right) &amp; t^2 &amp; + &amp; \left( 2 \langle \vec{\mathbf{c}'}, \vec{\mathbf{d}} \rangle \right) &amp; t &amp; + &amp; \left( \Vert \vec{\mathbf{c}'} \Vert ^ 2 - r^2 \right) &amp; = &amp; 0
    \end{array}
  <p>

  <p>The variables here are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>`vec bbd` is the direction vector for the ray.</li>
    <li>`vec bbc'` = `vec bbo - vec bbc`, where `vec bbo` is the origin of the ray, and `vec bbc` is the center of the sphere.</li>
    <li>`r` is the radius of the sphere.</li>
    <li>`t` is the value we're solving for. Out of all possible solutions, we want the lowest one.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Using the quadratic formula, we know the solutions to this equation are:</p>

  <ul class="math-list">
    <li>`t = {-b +- sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}} / {2a}`</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Start by calculating `a`, `b` and `c`. You'll need to support taking the dot product of two vectors.</p>

  <p>Next, calculate the <em class="term">discrimant</em>, that is the quantity `b^2 - 4ac`. There are two possibilities:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>The discriminant is negative. In that case, `t` cannot be a real number, so the ray does not intersect with the sphere.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>The discriminant is zero or positive. We can treat these two cases the same. Calculate the two values of `t` using the quadratic formula and pick the smaller one.</p>
      <p>Only pick values of `t` that are greater than 1. Remember that value lower than 1 means the intersection happens before the image plane, maybe even behind the camera. If neither value of `t` is greater than 1, the ray does not intersect the sphere.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="step">Figure out which sphere a ray sees</h2>

  <p>After performing all the intersection tests for a single ray, there are two possibilties:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>The ray does not intersect <em>any</em> sphere. Color the corresponding pixel black.</p></li>
    <li><p>The ray intersects at least one sphere. Out of the spheres the ray intersects, pick the one with the lowest `t`. Color the corresponding pixel the color of that sphere.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the reference image, we added three spheres of three different colors. The resulting image looks like this:</p>

  <div class="figure" id="figure-unshaded-spheres">
    <img width="256" alt="Three spheres of three different colors. All the spheres are flat." src="../img/unshaded-spheres.png"/>
